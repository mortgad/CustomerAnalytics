# Results: significant evidence for all hypotheses

# Implications:
# H1-H3: The positive relationship between compatibility (CPA), 
# trialability (TRI), and attitude (ATT) towards the app 
# with customers' continuance intention (INT) underscores 
# the importance of creating a user-friendly app that aligns
# with users' needs and preferences. Businesses should focus
# on personalizing the user experience and offering trial 
# features that allow users to fully explore the app's 
# functionalities. This can lead to a more favorable 
# attitude toward the app, enhancing customer retention.


# H4-H5: The positive relationship between the perceived 
# relative advantage (RA) of the app and continuance intention
# mediated by trialability, indicates that introducing 
# innovative features and updates can significantly impact 
# users' decisions to continue using the app. 
# It also highlights the role of trialability in allowing 
# users to experience these advantages firsthand.

# H6-H7: The positive relationship between observability (OBS) 
# and continuance intention, mediated by positive attitudes (ATT),
# highlights the importance of social proof and word-of-mouth in 
# driving app retention. Observability refers to how visible the 
# benefits of using the app are to others, which can influence 
# potential users' attitudes and their decision to adopt and continue 
# using the app.

# Overall Business Implications

# Customer-Centric Approach: These findings emphasize the need for a 
# customer-centric approach in app development , focusing on 
# personalization, innovation, and community building.

# Strategic Product Development: Businesses should strategically 
# plan product development to ensure that new features and updates
# not only offer real value but are also easily trialable and observable 
# to users.

# Leverage Social Proof: By leveraging social proof through 
# observability and positive word-of-mouth, businesses can enhance 
# user attitudes and foster a supportive community that encourages 
# continued app usage.

# Conclusion 
# In conclusion, understanding and leveraging the relationships between 
# compatibility, trialability, perceived relative advantage, observability, 
# attitude, and continuance intention can provide businesses with strategic 
# insights into enhancing customer retention in the competitive app market.

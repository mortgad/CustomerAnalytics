# Application 2: 
# Identifying populations with Positive Expected Lift in Profit (ELP)
# and targeting
################################################################################
# The idea is to use BN to identify segments of customers that will most likely 
# purchase when sending the ad (persuadable segments) and avoid sending the ad 
# to the rest (to the ones who will not buy the advertised product ever, 
# to the ones who will be offended by receiving an unwanted advertisement or 
# call, or to the ones who will always buy)

# If historical data is available, we start learning the relationships between 
# the variables train and select the best model as a preliminary step. 
# First we use the model structure from the text (given),and we only have to 
# learn the parameters (probabilities).
# Next, we focus exclusively on how model is used as a decision support for 
# marketing managers.

#  - r_u = the income obtained from a sale to a unsolicited customer

# Discussion: 
# Using BN, this application allows to identify persuadable segments of 
# individuals who would buy only if they are sent an ad. It avoids sending 
# ads to those who will never buy, those who always buy (thus avoid wasting the 
# ad), and those who are turned off by the advertisement when they receive it.
# The network can be extended with more nodes according to the characteristics 
# of the population in the dataset.

# In this analysis, we implement a latent class analysis with BN. 
# This classification is not directly observable; it is inferred from the data. 
# The key premise is that membership in a particular latent class can accurately
# predict a user's ratings across a range of items. 
# This method offers a comprehensive to product recommendation 
# by considering several factors:

    # User Similarities: By analyzing patterns across users, the model 
    # identifies underlying groups of users who exhibit similar behavior 
    # in their ratings. This helps in understanding user preferences and 
    # can be used to predict how a user might rate items that they have not 
    # yet encountered, based on the behavior of similar users within the 
    # same latent class

    # Item Similarities: Similarly, the model accounts for the relationships 
    # between items. It recognizes that certain items are consistently rated 
    # similarly by users, suggesting that these items share appealing 
    # characteristics or cater to specific interests

    
    # User-Item Interactions: Beyond examining users and items in isolation, 
    # this approach delves into the interactions between users and items. 
    # It explores how particular types of users tend to rate certain kinds of
    # items, capturing the dynamic interplay between user preferences and item 
    # characteristics
